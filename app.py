doesn't, it's the service itself.

    `run_attacks.py` and `run_eval.py` read `model_score` and `style_score`
    straight off this response and put them in your reports. Leave them out and
    every row of next unit's evidence says `null` — which is exactly the
    diagnostic you need to name a stage and a mechanism. You do not want to
    find that out after running the attack set.

    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Build it in three passes. Do not skip ahead — the ordering is how you tell
    a broken route from a broken signal.

    **Milestone 3 — the route answers.**
      1. Return a hardcoded response. Confirm `curl` gets it back before you
         add any logic at all.
      2. Then pull `text` and `creator_id` out of the payload.
      3. Then call ONE signal — `detector.model_signal(text)` — and put the
         real number in. Leave confidence and label as placeholders.
      4. Log every submission with `audit.log_decision(...)`. The content_id
         matters: `/appeal` needs it, and a student who skips it rebuilds this
         whole flow later.

    **Milestone 4 — the second signal and the score.**
      5. Add `stylometry.style_signal(text)`.
      6. Combine them with `scoring.combine_signals(...)`.
      7. Log BOTH signal scores alongside the combined one, and put them in the
         response too. Next unit you can't diagnose anything without them.

    **Milestone 5 — the label.**
      8. `scoring.score_to_label(...)` and put the real label in the response.

    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Worth deciding early, because unit 8's attack set will decide it for you:
    what should this do when `text` is missing, empty, or enormous? A crash on
    a malformed input is one of the most common real failures there is.
